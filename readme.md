## About this

Simple terrain generation test based on simplex noise.  
Code is pretty horrible for now, and the whole thing is a work in progress.  

For now, it does the following:  
- Generates a two dimension array map with heights from 0 to 1  
- Builds the map either in DOM or in Canvas

TODO:  
- Add moisture, to create more interesting biomes  
- Add temperature, to add even more diversity  
- Isometric visualization?  
- Three.js for 3d visualization?   
- ...
